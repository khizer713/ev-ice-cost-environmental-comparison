Worksheet Summary
- Charge Stats : actual usage logs for Tesla Model Y Long Range
- Tracker Pivot : Weekly summary of miles driven, Gas equivalent Miles and Actual cost of Charging from home and super charger.
- Constants : Constant values used in calculations.  Used in support of actual and scenario based simulation
- FPL Bill Summary : Florida Power and Light (FPL) Electric Bill history
- Cost Saving Chart : Cost charts comparing total electric vs gas equivalent 
- Emissions Chart : Breakdown of Elemental components of Natural Gas vs Liquid gas. Natural Gas used to power home/Super Chargers and charge an EV vs Liquid gas for ICE Car (NOTE : Coal is not considered as a energy store since coal is only used in a small percentage of states and at peak usage). All Charging is done in off-peak hours when on a home charger.
- Emission Chart (Scenario) : scenario based environmental impact.
- Emissions Saving : data used to calculate the differences in emissions between liquid Gasoline and Natural Gas.
- Gas Chemistry : Facts gathered on the elemental components of Liquid Gasoline and Natural Gas.
